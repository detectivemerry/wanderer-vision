          Hey there! I'm Clinton, a freelance cameraman based in Singapore with
          a passion for capturing lifeâ€™s best moments. I started my journey
          working under a professional photography company, where I gained
          hands-on experience shooting weddings, events, and all kinds of
          special occasions. Now, as a freelancer, I bring that same dedication
          and eye for detail to every shoot, making sure each moment is
          beautifully preserved. Whether itâ€™s a big wedding celebration or a
          corporate event, I aim to tell your story through natural, heartfelt,
          and high-quality images. Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸ“¸
